                    <h5>Elementary - Senior High School</h5>
                    <p>I still occasionally get vivid flashes of my elementary school days. The one consistent setting keeping my upbringing together was grade school. I recall that when I was at school, I was free from the stress of my chaotic home life. I consistently received honors, therefore I would say that I am quite competent. However, I was a pretty reserved girl back then, and I detested interacting with others frequently. But as I entered high school, this is where I changed from a confused little girl to a self-assured young woman prepared to face her future.This was the period of time in high school when I first met the friends I remained close to. They are one of my sources of inspiration and motivation, and they also assist me with my academic work, which is something I value greatly. I was among the pupils who had earned high honors and I, too, achieved excellent grades.</p>
                    <p>As I turned college, this is where I've been challenged a lot. Since I am still in first year, there are already a lot of changes and adjustments that I have done. However, this is just the start of my prosperous life. College is incredibly difficult. I'm confident that all of the struggles I've gone through and will go through will be well worth it.</p>
